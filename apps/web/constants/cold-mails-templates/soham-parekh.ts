<p>I love everything about what <strong>[Company Name]</strong> is doing. I don't have many hobbies outside coding I'm not athletic, bad at singing, don't drink, and can't dance. Building is the only thing I am good at. Right now I want to be part of taking something from <em>0 → 1</em> or <em>1 → 100</em> and be heads down chasing that goal.

</p> <p>Hi,</p> <p>Really loved what you were building at <strong>[Company Name]</strong> and wanted to reach out to see if there were any openings for engineers on the early team. I have 5 years of relevant experience building full-stack, data-driven applications at early teams including <a href="https://dynamo.ai">DynamoAl</a>, <a href="https://antimetal.com">Antimetal</a>, <a href="https://union.ai">Union.ai</a>, <a href="https://synthesia.io">Synthesia</a>, and <a href="https://alan.app">Alan</a>, where I helped scale internal microservices to thousands of workflows and users.</p>

<p>Being part of super-lean teams, one of my strongest suits is the ability to work across the stack from building scalable, robust backend systems and high-throughput data ingestion pipelines to production-grade frontend components in React. I have built several end-to-end systems that span multiple layers at the intersection of UI and infrastructure: UI (Next.js), backend services (Python, Node, Go using GraphQL and gRPC), and infrastructure (AWS & GCP on Kubernetes).</p> <p>Some highlights of work I've done include building complex workflows and DAG visualizations, a drag-and-drop component canvas for Union Cloud, and architecting platform pieces for Alan Studio and Synthesia.</p>

<p>I would love to join the early team at <strong>[Company Name]</strong> and help define its work and culture. Looking forward to hearing from you soon!</p>

<p>Best,<br /> 
[Your Name]</p>
