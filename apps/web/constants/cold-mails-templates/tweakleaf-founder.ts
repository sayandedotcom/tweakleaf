  Tired of ghosting other interview emails for this opportunity! Driven by the idea of AI agents with DeFi. As a generalist, I know opportunities like this, where I can work across full-stack, AI, and Web3, are rare; that’s exactly what gives me dopamine shots about working across domains. I genuinely believe I can bring even more to the table.

<p>Hi [Hiring Manager's Name],</p>

<p>
  I’m a bit late (29 days) in applying for this amazing lifetime opportunity: <strong>[Job Title]</strong> 
  [ Link ], and I didn’t want to miss the chance to get your attention, so I’m reaching out directly.
</p>

<p>
  I have experience building full-stack applications (Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.) from scratch, 
  developing microservice applications (Docker, Kubernetes), creating AI RAG applications & AI Agents 
  (LangChain, LangGraph), building CI/CD pipelines, and deploying them across cloud environments (AWS/GCP).
</p>

<p>
  My tech stack aligns completely with the required tech stack outlined in the job description. I'm confident that I’m a strong fit for the role and driven by the idea of AI agents operating in DeFi, something I truly believe can reshape the future of financial systems. I want to be part of this agentic revolution with a fast-paced, small team where my contributions can have maximum impact. I’m very bullish on [Company Name]'s future and would love to play the long-term game. This opportunity to become an early member of a startup like this is rare and incredibly exciting to me.
